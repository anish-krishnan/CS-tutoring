								<h2>It's hard to come up with an idea and develop the project on your own</h2>
								<p>It's often hard to know where to start. Computer science is a broad field with many categories, and it can become overwhelming to research everything on your own. You can start by learning a programming language, but it might not take you in the right direction. We're here to help. </p>
								<p>Our mission is to provide one-on-one sessions to students from any range of expertise. We create a roadmap that guides you towards making your project.</p>
								<h2>How does it work? How do I sign up?</h2>
								<p>First, fill out this <a href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUNgqfWN5Os3chmc1rwU-vv8T_gjeiMDlEdvegpbqVE_Zlcw/viewform?usp=sf_link" target = "_blank">form</a>. We think about every response carefully and strucutre a curriculum around you. Then, we schedule one virtual session together to build your roadmap and walk you through the first lesson. After the session is over, you let us know if you want to continue. If you choose to continue, cancellation is free at anytime. </p>

								<h2>What do you do you teach during the sessions?</h2>

								<p> <a href="https://coda.io/d/CS-Tutoring_dsQ0HQfraRg" target = "_blank"> Click here </a> to see an example curriculum and get more information about how the weeks will look. 

								<h2>What does the roadmap include?</h2>

								<p> The roadmap will be a step by step guide into how you should learn about the technologies for your project, and how you should apply them. We've seen countless projects in the past, and we know what technologies you need to learn to create yours. We will provide you with a step by step guide along the way.</p>

								<h2>Costs</h2>

								<p> Ten weeks (1 session a week + office hours): <strong>$950</strong> </p>

								<p> Ten weeks (2 sessions a week + office hours): <strong>$1425</strong> </p>

								<p> Ten weeks (3 sessions a week + office hours): <strong>$1900</strong> </p>

								<p> <strong>Explanation of prices:</strong> The first week is always 50% off (as low as $50). We charge $100 for 1 session and 1 week of office hours, $150 for 2 sessions and 1 week of office hours, and $200 for 3 sessions and 1 week of office hours. For example, if you want to make a project in ten weeks with 1 session a week and 24/7 office hours for 10 weeks, your price would be $100*10 = $1000, minus 50% from the first week, so your total is $1000 - $50 = $950. If you want to make a project in ten weeks with 2 sessions a week and 24/7 office hours, your price would be $150*10 - $75 = $1425. And so on. </p> 

								<h2>Refund and Paying Policy</h2>

								<p> Students will need to pay weekly before the first session of the week begins. We encourage students to pay for the entire package upfront to guarantee no delays in service. Should the student decide to cancel our service, students will be refunded the full amount for all weeks in which they have not attended the sessions. For example, if a student paid tuition upfront and canceled before the 5th session, they will be refunded for weeks 5 to 12, inclusive. </p>
