											It's well known that technical projects help your resume stand out. People often have a great project idea but don't know where to start. That's where we come in. We brainstorm a project idea with you, provide a roadmap, and guide you along the way. We set definitive goals and milestones to make sure you're achieving the goals you set out to accomplish. 
										</p>

										<p>
											Our customized roadmap is what makes us unique. We push you in the right direction to learn the right technologies. Once you've understood the technologies enough, we guide you through using those technologies on your project. 
										</p>
										<p>
											You can create your project in as little as 6 weeks.

										You tell us your goal, and we make it happen. <br/>
									   We curate our curriculum to <b> your needs and goals. </b> That's what makes us unique. <br />
									   Understanding the fundamental concepts in computer science is <b>crucial</b> to success.</br/></p>

											<li><b>Syne</b> Sign Language to Speech Converter. Click <a href = "https://youtu.be/YZfCtv7U_dM" target = "_blank"> here </a> to see the video. </br> 
											</br> 
											<p> 
											"Our project converts sign language to speech, using machine learning and infrared detection. The program gathers (x,y,z) coordinates of 15 joints in the hand using a leap motion. We map these joints to 3D vectors relative to the palm. The vectors are normalized to ensure that hand size does not affect the accuracy of the system. Our neural network takes in the 45 data points and uses three dense hidden layers to categorize the hand gestures as one of 26 letters. The model was trained with thousands of readings for each letter and has over 99% accuracy." </p></li>

											<li><b>Decuiduo</b> ML Reinforcement Learning to Find Optimal Amount of Foods to Eat. Click <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEYBXUHcJYw&feature=emb_logo" target = "_blank"> here </a> to see the video. </br> 
											</br> 
											<p> 
											"Deciduo is a program that uses psychological inputs to learn and detect what foods/exercises make people happy and prevent them from quitting their diets. Using machine learning and Lagrange optimization, the program learns what types of foods/exercises maximize people's happiness over time while keeping them healthy. You can also use other people's algorithms to see what they would prefer." </p></li>

											<li><b>Optimal Room Lighting</b> ML Evolutionary Program to Find the Best Lighting in a Room. Click <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WT_Uny6IqI&feature=emb_logo" target = "_blank"> here </a> to see the video. </br> 
											</br> 
											<p> 
											"In this project, we created an evolutionary program that finds the best lighting in a room for the cheapest cost. We took many characteristics into account, including brightness, location, light spread, cost, number of lights, obstacles, etc. The algorithm can be adjusted for mutation rate, population size per generation, number of generations, and obstacle locations. Our results showed that, on the room scheme shown in the video, three lights around the center with medium illumination provides optimal (and cheap) lighting." </p></li>

											<li><b>Expert Engine</b> Matching Resumes to projects. Click <a href = "https://www.experfy.com" target = "_blank"> here </a> to see their website. </br> 
											</br> 
											<p> 
											"Expert Engine is an AI recommender system created for internal use at Experfy (a startup at the Harvard Innovation Labs) to help match experts to proposed projects. The program sifts through thousands of expert bios to determine whose skills are related to the projects that are bid to the company. Using Natural Language Processing and word2vec, the program cleans the input information, determines the skills necessary for the projects, and ranks the experts in order of who can meet and exceed those requirements." </p></li>
