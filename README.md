# Welcome to CS Tutoring!

Due to COVID-19, a lot of high school students have lost their summer opportunities. To help these students, I co-founded an organization called CS-Tutoring (https://cs-tutoring.com) that allows high school students to create computer science projects from scratch.

Students can be from any programming background, including no experience. We teach them Python and structure a project roadmap. The program is 10-weeks long and includes one-on-one sessions throughout the week, as well as 24/7 office hours via text or email.
