								<h2>CS is hard to dive into</h2>
								<p>It's often hard to know where to start. Computer science is a broad field with many categories, and it can become overwhelming to reseach everything on your own. You can start by learning a programming language, but it might not take you in the right direction. We're here to help. </p>
								<p>Our mission is to provide one-on-one tutoring to students from any range of expertise. We teach middle school students to industry exectuives. Just tell us the goal and see the results for yourself. </p>
								<h2>How does it work? How do I sign up?</h2>
								<p>First, fill out this <a href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUNgqfWN5Os3chmc1rwU-vv8T_gjeiMDlEdvegpbqVE_Zlcw/viewform?usp=sf_link" target = "_blank">form</a>. We think about every response carefully and strucutre a curriculum around you. Then, we schedule one free virtual session together and assign you practice problems. After the session is over, you let us know if you want to continue. If you choose to continue, cancellation is free at anytime. We also provide free help via email for your practice problems. </p>

								<h2>What do you learn during the hourly sessions?</h2>

								<p> We do interactive tutoring. We teach something, ask you to apply it, and repeat. Our tutoring sessions will be structured around a curriculum that we'll create for you. If you're curious how it works, sign up for a free session!</p>

								<h2>Costs</h2>

								<p> The first session is always free. After the first session we charge $80 for each one-hour session, which includes structuring a curriculum for you, teaching the curriculum, practice problems, and practice problem help via email. </p>
